question:-why java 8
Ans:-Significant reason to introduce java8 is the conciseness of the code
java 8 had introduce functional programming which enabled by lambda expression and it is the powerfull tool to create concise code base.

features
1-lambda expression and functional programming
2-Stream Api
3-Default method in interface
4-static method
5-functioanl interface
6-optional
7-method references
8-Date Api
9-Nashron ,javascript engine.

Advantage of java 8

1-We can create concise code and less boiler plate code.means no redundate code.
2-more readable and more reusable code
3-more testable code
4-parallel operations

que:-what is lambda expression
ans:-Lambda expression is the anonymous function (without name,access modifier and return type) having one lambda symbol or operator
normally in conventional java we wrote
public void sayHello(int a,int b)
{
System.out.println(a+b)
}
same we can wrote
(a,b)-> System.out.println(a+b);    :-this shorten the code.this is called concise code.

BiConsumer:-it takes two argument of similar kind of object and does not return value.it performs only operation
question:-what is functional interface
ans:-Functional interfaces are those interfaces which have only one abstract method.it can have any static method,default method and no restrictions on that
there are many java function interface present already such as Comparable,Runnable
LongUnaryOperator and UnaryOperator:-both works on single value operand.but first works on long value and second works on the non-long value like primitive

Method reference:- :: this is the method reference which is used to refer the method of functional interface.it came in java for code reusability
Default method:-default method is a way for adding new method in the interface without affecting the implementation class.The use of default method is backward
compatibility.
Diamond Problem:--if two implemented interfaces contains same default methods then that is the diamond problem
Quest:-Are static method available to implementing classes by default
Ans:-Static methods are not available to implementing classes.hence you can call static methods in class using interfacename.methodname.
Predicate:-it is functional interface and it is used to test some boolean  condition.it return boolean value always .It provides code reusability
quest:-What is predicate joining
Ans:-three ways to join
And(),Or(),Negate()
Function:-It takes one argument and performs some operation and returns any value of any type
Consumer:-It takes only input but it does not return anything.
Suplier:-it will always provide a value or object to the user.it does not take any input.
